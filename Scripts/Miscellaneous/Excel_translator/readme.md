**About the program**
You can use this program as a quick translator for your excel files, if 
you want to translate a lot of rows in as small time as possible.
(Note: For big files, the execution might be bit slow, but still much faster than manual translation. If any error occured while translating the program will stop at that moment and write the present translated rows in the excel. rest rows will be copied as it is.)
