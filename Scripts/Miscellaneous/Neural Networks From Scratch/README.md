# Neural Network from Scratch

This is an implementation of a multilayer perceptron from scratch for learning purposes. After the model is implemented, it is shown a very simple example of how a neural netowork can learn to predict the output of a XOR logic gate.

## How it works
Neural networks are one of the most popular machine learning algorithms. They are made of smaller entities called artificial neurons, similar to the human brain. Each neuron has weights that gives more or less importance to specific inputs. These weights are updated in a process called training where it is shown to the model examples of input and the desired output, where it will eventualy become able to predict the output for a given input.

## Pre-requisites
- Python 3
- NumPy

## How to run
Execute in your terminal:
```
python neural_net.py
```
