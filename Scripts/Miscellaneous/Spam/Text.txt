Day and night
I toss and turn, I keep stressing my mind, mind
I look for peace but see I don't attain
What I need for keeps, this silly game we play, play
Now look at this
Madness the magnet keeps attracting me, me
I try to run but see I'm not that fast
I think I'm first but surely finish last, last

'Cause day and night
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at night
He's all alone through the day and night
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at night
At, at, at night
Day and night
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at night
He's all alone, some things will never change
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at night
At, at, at night

Slow mo'
When the tempo slows up and creates that new, new
He seems alive though he is feelin' blue
The sun is shinin', man he's super cool, cool
The lonely nights
They fade away, he slips into his white Nike's
He smokes a clip and then he's on the way
To free his mind in search of
To free his mind in search of
To free his mind in search of

Day and night
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at night
He's all alone through the day and night
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at night
At, at, at night
Day and night
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at night
He's all alone, some things will never change
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at night
At, at, at night, night
At, at, at night, night
