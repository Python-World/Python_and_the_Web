None

### How to run the script
<!--Remove the below lines and add yours -->
A test is inside the script, so you just need to change the variable "image_path" in the "main" function for a PGM ASCII image path then run: python3 PGM.py
If you want to use another image or something, just follow the example given in the "main" function.
You can get another images from: https://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/data/pgma/pgma.html

WARNING: You have to use ASCII coded images.
