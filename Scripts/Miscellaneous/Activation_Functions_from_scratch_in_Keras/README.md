# ActivationFunctions using Custom Layers in Keras
Activation functions are an important are of deep learning research .Many new activation functions are being developed ,these include *bio-inspired* activtions, *purely mathematical activation functions* including others . Despite, such advancements we usually find ourselves using RELU and LeakyRELU commonly without using/thinking about others.
In the following notebooks I showcase how easy/difficult it is to port an activation function using **Custom Layers in Keras and Tensorflow!**
