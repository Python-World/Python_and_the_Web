#### **Flask web application **

This is a web application built in flask to detect if a given news
article based on the 2016 US presidential election is real or
fake.

The web application uses NLP techniques to check the reality
of the news article.

The fake-news folder contains the data on which the machine
learning model that predicts the fake news is trained.

To test the model you can simply pick data from the fake-news 
folder and give it as input(screenshots can be referred) and
the model will predict the output.
