You have n gifts and you want to give all of them to children. Of course, you don't want to offend anyone, so all gifts should be equal between each other. The i-th gift consists of a_i candies and b_i oranges.During one move, you can choose some gift 1 \le i \le n and do one of the following operations:  eat exactly one candy from this gift (decrease a_i by one);  eat exactly one orange from this gift (decrease b_i by one);  eat exactly one candy and exactly one orange from this gift (decrease both a_i and b_i by one). Of course, you can not eat a candy or orange if it's not present in the gift (so neither a_i nor b_i can become less than zero).As said above, all gifts should be equal. This means that after some sequence of moves the following two conditions should be satisfied: a_1 = a_2 = \dots = a_n and b_1 = b_2 = \dots = b_n (and a_i equals b_i is not necessary).Your task is to find the minimum number of moves required to equalize all the given gifts.You have to answer t independent test cases.InputThe first line of the input contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 1000) — the number of test cases. Then t test cases follow.The first line of the test case contains one integer n (1 \le n \le 50) — the number of gifts. The second line of the test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9), where a_i is the number of candies in the i-th gift. The third line of the test case contains n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n (1 \le b_i \le 10^9), where b_i is the number of oranges in the i-th gift.OutputFor each test case, print one integer: the minimum number of moves required to equalize all the given gifts.ExampleInput

NoteIn the first test case of the example, we can perform the following sequence of moves:  choose the first gift and eat one orange from it, so a = [3, 5, 6] and b = [2, 2, 3];  choose the second gift and eat one candy from it, so a = [3, 4, 6] and b = [2, 2, 3];  choose the second gift and eat one candy from it, so a = [3, 3, 6] and b = [2, 2, 3];  choose the third gift and eat one candy and one orange from it, so a = [3, 3, 5] and b = [2, 2, 2];  choose the third gift and eat one candy from it, so a = [3, 3, 4] and b = [2, 2, 2];  choose the third gift and eat one candy from it, so a = [3, 3, 3] and b = [2, 2, 2].
