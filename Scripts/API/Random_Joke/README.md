# Joke generator
*A simple script to get jokes*

## Setup
- Set up your environment
  - Download python 3 (tested with 3.8)
  - Install pip
  - Check that `pip` and `python` point to the right installation
  - Make a virtual environment and activate it (suggested, can be skipped)
- Get the code on your machine
  - Clone the repo `git clone https://github.com/Python-World/Python_and_the_Web.git`
  - Move to this directory `cd Python_and_the_Web/Scripts/API/Random_Joke`
- Install requirements `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Run it! `python joke.py` (on linux it's possible to run it with `./joke.py` too but you'll need to `chroot +x joke.py`)

## Usage
You can specify categories and types of jokes to avoid with `--category` and `--exclude`

**Note** that values are *cAsE uNsEnSiTivE* and *comma,separated*.
While `--category dark,pUn` is ok, `--category Dark Pun` isn't.

See the [Examples](#examples)

### Category (--category)
There are 4 categories:
- Programming
- Dark
- Pun
- Miscellaneous

There is `any` which chooses a random one.

If a non valid category is passed, an error will be written to stderr and the exit code will be `1`.

If you do not specify a category, `any` will be chosen.

### Types to exclude (--exclude)
There are 5 types of jokes:
- Nsfw
- Religious
- Political 
- Racist 
- Sexist

Passing `--exclude nsfw` will exclude nsfw jokes and the same applies to the other types. 

If you don't specify anything nothing will be excluded: you could get an nsfw joke.
