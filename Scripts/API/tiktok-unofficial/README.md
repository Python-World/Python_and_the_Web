## I have created webapplication using heroku and unofficial tiktok api by David Teather [here](https://github.com/davidteather/TikTok-Api)

## Watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwLmLfVI-VQ) to get your own `Custom_verifyFp`, which is an argument in the web app itself.

## Link to the webapp 
 - [Here]

## NOTE: This is solely made upon the unofficial API, and it is meant to create only for the educatinal purposes.
